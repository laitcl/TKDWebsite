					<h2>Belt Tests</h2>
					<p>Thanks to head coach <a href="Instructors.html"> Dan Chuang </a> and our dojang's grandmaster Han D. Cho, our team is provided a curriculum from beginner level (white belt) to advanced (black belts, certified by <a href="http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/front/eng/main2.action"> Kukkiwon</a>).</p>
					<p>Members whom have shown their effort in practice (determined by instructors) throughout each semester will be eligible to one or more belt tests. There are ten divisions from white belt to 1st Dan black belt; in each test, students will be challenged with progressive difficulty. The typical length of our club members to reach 1st Dan black belt is approximately 3.5 years. </p>
