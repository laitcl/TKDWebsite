		<p> The 2010 National Collegiate Taekwondo Championships will be held April 17-18 in Denver, Colorado at the Metropolitan State College of Denver. For more information, visit the <a href="http://kattaekwondo.com/ncta/index.html" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>
		<p>We will be flying down to Denver on Friday and staying Friday and Saturday nights. The cost per competitor will be around $200. We highly encourage everyone to go--keep in mind that April 17 and 18 are the first two days of a four-day weekend!</p>

		<p class="header">General Information</p>
		<p>There are several differences between Nationals and ECTC tournaments, including the following:
		<p><ul>
			<li>You will only compete in forms and sparring against those of your own rank and weight.<br></br></li>
			<li>Sparring is individual, so you will not be sparring on a team.<br></br></li>
			<li>The points you earn when medaling in sparring or forms is the same regardless of rank and will make up the school's total (a yellow belt placing first in forms earns as many points as a black belt placing first in forms).<br></br></li>
			<li>There will be three rounds of sparring, as opposed to two in the ECTC. Color belt rounds are one minute long, and black belt rounds are two minutes long.<br></br></li>
			<li>For sparring, there are four weight divisions for color belts and eight for black belts. For forms, there are two weight divisions for all ranks.<br></br></li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>For a full listing of rules and weight classes at Nationals, visit the Nationals <a href="http://www.kattaekwondo.com/ncta/rules.html" target="_blank">rules page</a>.</p>
