								<h1><a href="#">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>
								<p><b>When does the club practice?</b>
								<br>
								There are classes held on Monday and Wednesdays from 7:30-9:00pm and Fridays from 7:30-9:30pm in the DuPont basketball courts. Sunday practice is from 1:00-2:30pm in the T-Club Lounge. Assistant instructors hold "Office Hours" from 9:00-10:00pm after weekday practices in the DuPont basketball courts. More info can be found on our <a href="classes.html">Classes</a> page.</p>
								
								<p><b>How often do members attend classes?</b>
								<br>Most people attend about two classes a week, but many come to all the practices each week. Members are encouraged to come as often as possible to get the most out of the club.</p>
								
								<p><b>How much does it cost to join the club?</b>
								<br>First off, all fees are waived for those who can't pay them. Just talk to Master Chuang or club president <a href="mailto:sport-tkd-info@mit.edu">Iris Hwang</a> if you have any questions about that. Semester dues are usually around $50, and tournament fees are between $30 and $40 based on transportation costs.
								
								<p><b>Do I need my own uniform or any equipment?</b>
								<br>If you want to compete with the club at any of our tournaments, you will need your own uniform. A basic uniform is FREE with your first club dues. Having your own sparring equipment is not necessary because you can borrow club gear. However, most people do have their own gear because, in that case he/she's the only person sweating in it.</p>
								
								<p><b>How often does the club compete in tournaments?</b>
								<br>There are five ECTC league tournaments a year, three in the fall and two in the spring. We also compete at the NCTA Collegiate Nationals, usually held in April at a different college each year. The tournament schedule is listed on the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a> page.</p>
								
								<p><b>Do I have to compete to be in the club?</b>
								<br>Not at all. While we do encourage all club members to compete or just watch tournaments (they're always high energy and a TON of fun!), there is no official requirement.</p>
							
								<p><b>What style of Taekwondo do you practice? What if I come from a different style? Will I continue to practice at my current rank?</b>
								<br>Our team practices World Taekwondo (WT) style. We acknowledge that there are many more styles of Taekwondo, and we will ensure a streamlined transition from your previous practice to our team. Please talk to our head coach Dan Chuang so that your appropriate level can be determined, and to make plans transitioning into our team.
								
								<p><b>I am not a student at MIT (MIT employee, student at another school, or anybody else in Boston); am I eligible to practice with you? </b>
								<br>If you are an employee, alum, or a cross registered student at MIT, you are eligible to practice with us, given that you secure your own entry to the ZeSiger Center (e.g. buy a monthly pass). You will not be allowed to compete with MIT. If your affiliation to MIT does not belong to any of the aforementioned categories, we recommend that you check out <a href="https://www.cwtkd.com/"> CW Taekwondo Boston </a> (located in Cambridge), which is also run by our head coach Dan Chuang.
								
								<p><b>I do not have any taekwondo experience. Will I be eligible to join MIT Sport Taekwondo?</b>
								<br>Your lack of experience will by no means be an obstactle for you to be part of the team. Over 70% of our team's member started like you. MIT's Taekwondo team also has a PE class offerred twice a year catered towards beginners, and most members earn their black belts in 3.5 years.
