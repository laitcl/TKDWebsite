		<p><b>4.15.2010 || Wednesday class, A/B Team workout,forms prep ||</b> <i>Mary</i></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><b>Notes from class</b></p>
		<p>Exchanges: A & B
		<br>&nbsp (1) A hits from race distance à B slides back out of the way
		<br>&nbsp (2) B slides back out of way (A misses) and A hits long
		<br>Hit long – anticipate your opponent moving back on the next exchange and figure that into your (new) distance. Aim for where they are going to be and be prepared to reach/adjust.
		<p>You can go long with long turning kick (reach). If you long distance is not good, you can also try (i) attacking double, (ii) fake first kick, hit on second, or (iii) chunjin turning kick. Make sure to do (ii), (iii) on “off beat” – more on this later.
		<p>(3a) A hits long and B jams
		<br>Jamming – if your opponent is on to your game of sliding out and they adjust by going deep, or you can change it up by going short instead. This means jamming, or alternatively, cover punch go short. Remember to COVER!
		<p>(4b) A hits on a chunjin, off the line (long attach) and B kicks on motion
		<br>The point here is to hit them on the way in (pada or short kick)
		<p>(5b) B kicks on motion (“twitch” fighter) and (i) cut to open, follow body or head shot, (ii) go high – bent leg ax to the face, or crescent. I suggest making it start off looking like a body shot, change to head, (iii) leg check
		<p><b>A/B Team Workout</b></p>
		<p>A few things we worked on:
		<br>(1) Importance of good motion – in and out, checks, cutting to the side
		<br>As you saw from the drill, it is hard to blindly adjust to how the other person will move (in or out) when you kick. In order to properly anticipate, use motions (and data from previous exchanges) to get a clue as to whether they’ll close à be prepared to adjust short, they’ll back up à be prepared to go long, or freeze à sitting duck.
		<p>Like Master Chuang said, as you are sparring, figure out what has happened in the last few exchanges, pick out the patterns, and figure out what you should do to adjust.
		<p>Don’t forget the cutting to the side and covering we did in the last A/B Workout (see old log entries). This still works well.
		<p>(2) Moving target exercise – this was to practice motion (for both people) – get a sense of how to get out of the way, lateral motion; for the attacker, different ways of attacking.
		<p>Bobby’s note: Attack on the half beat – not 1-and-2-and, but 1-2-and if you are preceding your attack with chunjin, fake or two kicks. If you use the same rhythm for both parts, your opponent will just move back twice, for example. If you throw your first kick, chunjin or fake fast and not out all the way, and surprise them on the second kick, that is when you score you will have gained distance and kicked them before they can back out again.
		<p>(3) Head shots – exercise to get the distance right, and against people of different heights.
		<br>Fighting taller people than yourself, you might have trouble getting over their shoulder, so you have to make an extra effort. Making space also helps if the other person is taller or if you are not flexible enough to take it up close. If they are shorter, it will be easier to hit them in the head, so you could hit headshot closer in the clinch – this gives you more surprise, since they can’t see it coming as well.
		<p>Anye’s note: lock the arm you are pushing out with, otherwise they will just close back up. Also, pin their arm right before you go to prevent them from blocking. If you keep your arm there when you kick, it might get in your way, so you just need to pin it right before you kick. By the time your foot is up there, it is too late for them to block.
		<p><i>Take-aways:</i>
		<br>-make the appropriate space
		<br>-lock arm
		<br>-pin

		<p>-One good time to attempt a headshot is right into the clinch before you both settle down. 
		<br>-Another good opportunity is if they are moving out of the clinch, especially if they aren't putting a lot of pressure on you. Think of it as them making the distance for you.

		<p><b>Extra Notes</b>
		<br>-A little ring management trick: sometimes if you are up and you are clinching or evading to kill time, try to face the score/time monitor. I find that people are more passive and less desperate if they aren't really aware of the time, especially struggling in the clinch.
		<br>-Sometimes if I am fighting defensive, if the opponent keeps coming closer, I feel like I'm always backing up. This is wrong way to do it. 
		<p>Two things: 
		<br>(a) Stay aggressive and engaged, check/motion back to keep them at bay
		<br>(b) If they come too close to you i.e. move into your range, go for it! Kick them! It is important though to keep in mind that if they are moving in, it might be a trap bait - <b>so, make sure you hit when they come in</b> (on their motion in), either that, or expect that they might move out a little. But, definitely don't let them keep backing you up. YOU need to control the ring!
		<p>For super-aggressive fighters that come at you all the time:
		<br>-Lateral motions! Keep them running in circles, and it is a lot harder for them to keep having to change direction
		<br>-Head shot, you can try front leg (faster, but if they are super close maybe not enough space/time to get your leg up) or back leg crescent (downside is more visible)
		<br>-Cut: even if you aren't very good at it, you can use this against people who are much shorter than you, because even if you don't push hard (and move forward) enough, their legs are too short to reach you. Caveat for people similar to your size, you have to push - not just put your foot on them -- or else they still have their balance and can counter. I made that mistake at WestPoint. 

		<p><b>Forms</b>
		<p>You've heard it from the experts (instructors), they say it best, but a few things to think about when approaching forms:
		<p>-Judges score on technicality <b>and</b> performance, so performance counts! This means loud POWER, loud kiyap (Yes sir! Yes ma'am!), confidence, intensity (facial expression, concentration)  
		<br>-When you are practicing, check your stances!!! Kill bad habits in the bud, and make sure you do them right the first time around.

		<p>Here are some common mistakes, and they are really easy to fix!!! The title will start sounding like some self-help book…

		<p><b>5 Easy Ways to Immediately Fix Your Form </b>
		<br>(1) Punching too high: middle punches to solar plexus, arm should not be level with shoulder, but lower
		<br>(2) Keep your body upright! A lot of people tend to hunch over or lean forward on front stances, this looks bad
		<br>(3) Keep back leg straight on front stances: My back leg tends to bend because the long front stance is kind of uncomfortable, but that it should be straight
		<br>(4) Retract leg after front kick (instead of letting it fall straight), and controlled landing into the next stance
		<br>(5) Ducky-stance: 90 degree foot (back foot) splays outward, this is really common after transitioning into a back stance. I do this all the time.

		<p><i>Other</i>
		<br>Keep working on your front kicks - height and sticking it. Can cheat a little on this by opening <i>slight (!)</i> to the non-kicking side
		<p>If you got all that down, think about <b>sharp transition</b> and prepping for it. We've been working on these a lot in class. Where does your foot need to move to twist into the next stance? Good transition will give you good power</p>

		<p><b>3.29.2010 || Sunday Practice ||</b> <i>Mary</i></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Up-bal to the head if other person feints cut to the side (your right, their left)
		<br>-hit them right when they reach 45 position

		<p>Long fast kick -> cut to closed side and cover
		<br>Otherwise can use the cut to open side, short kick/right leg off turning kick ready

		<p>Feint off the line (draw out pada), right crescent to the head

		<p><b>More on Checking</b>: throw what you didn't fake!
		<br>Reason: they are expecting you to throw what you faked
		<br>-if you check fake off the line -> go fast kick
		<br>-if you check fake fast kick (the stomp or front leg) -> go off the line
		<br>-fake back kick -> pada

		<p>Don't have to go all the way in the motion. Too much and you might not be able ot recover, but the motion should be sudden and convincing.

		<p>If you check and it doesn't seem to be scaring you opponent:
		<ol><li>you might not be doing it convincingly enough</li>
			<li>your opponent has nothing ready! If so, just race (go for it)</li>
			<li>experience opponent might just be expecting to race you - be careful. Maybe go for the face instead of body -> unexpected again. You: 3 points. If they hit: only 1 point. Hopefully you're faster…</li></ol>

		<p><b>3.27.2010 || Jason's C-Team Workout ||</b> <i>Mary</i><p>
		<blockquote><b>Traps</b>
		
		<p>(From closed stance, right leg back)
		<br>Bait: Chunjin (slide forward)
		<br>Trap: hoojin (slide back) and they come forward
		<br>Counter: turning kick/pada
		<br>-this will hit your opponents hogu open-side, so there is a big target

		<p>Bait: step-in right (il-bo chunjin)
		<br>Trap: slide out (hoojin)
		<br>Counter: turning kick/pada

		<p>Bait: step-in right (il-bo chunjin)
		<br>Trap: hoojin-cut 45 degrees
		<br>Counter: turning kick/pada

		<p>NOTES:
		<ol><li>For #3, you need to cut back some (actually hoojin, not just cut to the side) in order to avoid their kick, which is coming from the same side - assuming they do right leg off the line (turning kick)</li>
			<li>For all these, the bait must look convincing!!! You need to put yourself in semi-harm's way (yes, it can be a little scary, but you have the advantage since you know what is coming) for a very short period of time, or at least be in a range where your opponent could conceivably kick you or else they won't bite.</li>
			<li>That said, don't go too deep, or else your opponent will tag you. Focus on going in-n-out fast. Be ready to pull out the bait, and then execute the trap. </li>
			<li>Have something in mind for after your counter - (1) be ready, (2) kick again if the distance is right, (3) clinch or get out</li>
			<li>Beware of people will long reach, e.g. really experiences or much taller than you. They can go further than you think, so be ready to slide out more or be faster. That said, it can also mean they'll bite on bait that might be a little further, so you might not have to go in as far in the first place.</li></ol>

		<p>NOTE: there are many different kinds of checks, soft checks, fake kicks, left/right shoulder, and stomps/double stomps. Those are still really useful! So, I'm just talking about hard forward checks.</p>

		<p><b>Checks</b>
		
		<p><b>Something I learned recently about checks/baits:</b> I didn't used to do very convincing checks or baits (for traps), and I'm still working on it, but recently, I heard some advice that I think can be very helpful for making your checks look more threatening.

		<p><b>Doing ineffective checks are a waste of time and energy!!!</b>

		<p>NOTE: there are many different kinds of checks, soft checks, fake kicks, left/right shoulder, and stomps/double stomps. Those are still really useful! So, I'm just talking about hard forward checks.

		<p><b>RULE:</b> Checks should look like your kicks! A few guidelines:

		<ol><li><b>Don't be too far away:</b> If you are far away, no one is scared because (1) they don't expect you to be able to hit them from that distance, (2) they don't expect you to kick from there</li>
			<li><b>Don't just stomp</b> aka <b>check down</b> (all the time anyways): when a lot of us check, we stomp down. We do this probably because it is easy, doesn't require as much energy and doesn't take you into danger (closer). This is fine sometimes as a shocker sudden movement to get your opponent nervous, but it's really pretty useless after you've done it a few times, because it <b>doesn't actually look like a kick</b>. So, you'll just waste energy.</li>
			<li><b>Don't just check with your upper body</b>: it is good to throw out the cookie (your hand/arm) close to them, because it is not really putting you in danger, but <i>creates an illusion</i> that you are close plus it can be very distracting and obnoxious. However, just upper body is not convincing <i>as a kick</i></li>
			<li><b>Check engaging your lower body</b>: Given #2 and 3, what you should be thinking about to make the check look like a kick is engaging your hips/lower body, because that is what makes it look like a real kick - an actual kick comes from your lower body. It also helps if your lower body moves suddenly <i>before</i> or <i>with</i> your upper body. In a real kick, if you are actually going in, you'd probably move your legs ahead of your upper body because the lower body is your weapon and your upper body is the target. Moving the target in first doesn't make sense and so it doesn't look right.</li></ol>

		<p><b>Look at the instructors</b> next time they do checks or Jason :) See if any of the above applies and just how it looks. Try practicing in the mirror on your own. If you can scare yourself, chances are you can scare someone else.</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>3.25.2010 || Notes from Class ||</b> <i>Mary</i></p>
		<blockquote>Disclaimer: none of what I’m saying might be accurate and my tkd is not actually all that good, but they are just things that I think and can be a forum for discussion. Look for future corrections as I learn how to know better than to do _______.</p>
		<p>(Forgive all the Korean misspellings…I don’t actually know how to spell anything)</p>
		<p><b>Favorite move from Last Class:</b>
		<br>Step in hard, crescent to the head
		<br>-very unexpected…and it works even if you do it more than once against the same person! I’m guessing because unless they think fast, it is hard to figure out what to do on the spot.</p>

		<p><b>Something else unexpected that we don’t use often:</b>
		<br>Step back (il-bo hujin) and back leg turning kick
		<br>-use if other person does fast kick (from closed stance) – their hogu become open for your turning kick, and your now further away
		<br>-I hear this is not so good if the other person is coming at you with back leg turning kick and you start in closed stance: you open your hogu belly to them
		<br>-on the other hand, this has worked for me at practices if the other person doesn’t go deep since it takes me out of the way one body length…I guess, consult an instructor before attempting</p>

		<p><b>Covering</b>
		<br>My god, please COVER when you pada!
		<br>-make sure your arm is well away from your body, or else the kick can score through the arm, especially if the judges on the other side can’t see very well
		<br>-also cover in general, it is good for you (like carrots)</p>
		
		<p><b>If they do fast kick:</b>
		<br>The classic is counter back kick. I haven’t had much luck with this, mostly because I don’t spin enough, but here are a few things I picked up over the last few months as alternatives that might be helpful. 
		
		<p>-Cut 45 degrees (without switching legs) to the RIGHT, turning kick
		<br>-the counter should be on half-time (very quick), explode off the back leg
		<br>-Chris Han has told me one way to do it is to cut lifting right leg first. The result is that the right foot lands first and you can start the counter even as you finish cutting to the side, plus you have the moment of your weight bouncing off the back leg
		<br>-you might have to move back more on the cut since you need to avoid their kick, esp if they come in deep
		<br>-As always, COVER on the left!!!! 

		<p>-Cut 45 degrees to the LEFT, COVER with the right, turning kick
		<br>-you have to <i>switch your feet</i> on this. For switching, don’t elevate too much. Too slow.
		<br>-you can combine this with a punch wit your left 

		<p>-If you are taller, you can try up-bahl on motion. Because you have longer legs, you can hit them before they can get to you </p>
 
		<p><b>If they do turning kick: </b>

		<p><b>Slide back/cut to back+to the side Turning Kick/Pada</b>
		<br>My personal favorite!!! Especially if they tend to come up a little short, is to slide out (to the side some and back, but NOT straight back) and pada or turning kick as counters.
		<br>-this is <b>awesome</b>,  I swear: (A) you avoid getting hit (and frustrate them) so there is less danger to you, and you score!!! (B) This is a super easy way to score because they are completely vulnerable as they are putting their foot down.
		<br>-you have to counter quickly though, because once the moment passes (they put their foot down), they can easily get out of your way. So, be ready.
		<br>-The most trouble I’ve had with this is just freezing when the other person attacks. Just have to try to get out of the habit/mindset and hoojin out of the way when the other person attacks. 

		<p><i>NOTE:</i> this is not so good if the other person just likes to charge or run forward, unless you CUT TO THE SIDE, and this is super important, they’ll just close the distance faster than you can move back and hit you anyways.
		<br>-a modification of slide back turning kick is (1) cut to the side), (2) kick them while they are running forward. This can be a little difficult since the target is moving.
		<br>-There are other ways to deal with charging people</p></blockquote>
