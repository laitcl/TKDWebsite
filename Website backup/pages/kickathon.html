		<p>Kickathon will be Sunday, May 1 starting at 4:30pm on the Kresge Lawn. We'll be throwing 1000 kicks (each!) and raising money to help support the club in all that we do. A third of the proceeds from Kickathon will also go to support Partners in Health, a Boston-based non profit that is providing medical care to victims of the Haiti earthquake</p>
		<p>Collect donations from friends, family, professors, PIs, etc. and win awesome prizes for yourself or your belt group! Awards will be given to the two individuals who raise the most money as well as the belt group that raises the most money per person. Donors can make flat pledges, pledge a certain amount of money per kick, or buy boards for you to break (boards are $10 each).</p>
