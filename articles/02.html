							<h2 style="text-align: center">The Inner Conversation</h2>
								<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>03/26/2019</strong></p>
									<p>After a very rowdy meeting that determined the fate of his graduation, he dropped his belongings on his desk at the office, pondering about his plans for the rest of the week. An e-mail came in, notifying him that another manuscript of his was accepted to the Journal of Physical Chemistry Part A.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;Look at the times change; you were struggling to publish your first paper when I first met you in your fifth year. Now you&rsquo;re wrapped up with a third and working on a fourth.&rdquo; She said.</p>
									<p>The graduate student stood up from his desk and started walking out of the office.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;We should celebrate this success together.&rdquo; She continued.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you to an afternoon walk at Seaport to finish the day up.&rdquo; The graduate student replied.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still aren&rsquo;t over with me. Maybe the next time you decide to lose control in a sub-basement corridor you should keep this in mind.&rdquo; She became hostile.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;Every time this confrontation plays in my brain I look forward to it, because everything you say is something that I already came up with, and I will have no problem defusing it.&rdquo; The graduate student, said, walking down a hallway.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;You think you can ever defuse cheating on me?&rdquo; With stern eyes, she walks up to interrupt the graduate student&rsquo;s path.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;No, but I can come to terms with it. I am better than justifying my own mistakes by admitting to smaller faults.&rdquo; He replied calmly while sidestepping from the girl.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sociopath. You&rsquo;ve hurt me repeatedly, made me feel worthless for the duration of our relationship, and all you will do about it is to &lsquo;come to terms&rsquo;.&rdquo; She replied.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned to not to take the confrontation.&rdquo; The grad student sat down at the lobby of E25. Eyes closed, one breath at a time, her attitude became benign again.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I am not out to get you. I wish you would understand.&rdquo; She said.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;For a while it was easier to believe in your hostility. I would rather attribute the events that transpired towards you with a malicious intent. It was difficult to accept that you were acting in your personal gain, because it means the best for yourself doesn&rsquo;t involve me.&rdquo; The graduate student said with eyes closed.</p>
									<p>A moment of silence transpired. The student opened his eyes at the end of his meditation and voluntarily engaged her again. &ldquo;I had to move on. I wasn&rsquo;t happy with how things were turning out. I&rsquo;ve sworn new allegiances, and I am finally free to become whom I want myself to be.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>&ldquo;You are projecting your self-judgement to others. Nobody from the team thinks of you the way you think of yourself.&rdquo; She said.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I tend to agree with what you said. Truth is, there are only a handful of individuals that radically pass negative judgement towards me from the team, and considering how powerless and insignificant these people are, I should not be affected.&rdquo; He continued. &ldquo;Truth is, however, my actions were affected by them. I avoided contact with four or five members of the team, and I would eventually find myself unable to participate in anything because one of these few will be part of every interaction.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t just ignore them?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I am unable to authentically communicate with the rest of the members because of the presence of this handful of members; it&rsquo;s an emotional block. Nobody actually cares though, an interaction will continue with or without me, and I don&rsquo;t feel justified asking for people to take a side. I&rsquo;d rather leave quietly given the circumstances.&rdquo; The graduate student replied.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;To be fair, many of your actions are extremely controversial. As a leader you&rsquo;ve violated more rules than all eighteen previous leaders combined. You are openly sexual to multiple people, openly hostile against our competitors, and you don&rsquo;t seem to believe in any social norms. It&rsquo;s a natural consequence that you ended up being the one ostracized from this community.&rdquo; She reasoned.</p>
									<p>After spending a long moment formulating an elaborate response to how social norms go against his own authenticity, he decided to concede the argument. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t argue with hallucinations; I know everything my mind&rsquo;s projection of you would say, and it ends up being dissatisfying.&rdquo; He said, walking away from the girl.</p>
									<p>The graduate student sat back at his desk, writing an invitation to his thesis defense to individuals he was once close with. It was a simple message, but one that took an eternity to formulate.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;My thesis defense is on May 14th (Tuesday), 10-11am, in room E17-517. I'd like for you to come and be a part of it.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Finding closure to his anxiety, he moved on to tend to his responsibilities for the rest of the day.</p>
