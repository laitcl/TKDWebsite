							<h2 style="text-align: center">Before the Black Belt Test</h2>
								<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>06/19/2018</strong></p>
								<p>"You&rsquo;re late&rdquo; the testee said, in his performance shirt with big letters MIT printed on it.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I had something to do before this&rdquo; the instructor showed up in loosely fitted workout clothes.</p>
								<p>The testee spoke like he wanted this to start earlier. His body language directly contradicted what he said; lazily doing the butterfly stretch, flipping through his phone to check his texts. The instructor started running laps without communicating with the testee. The testee turned the music on, and joined the laps.</p>
								<p>It was a weird dynamic. Neither person was counting how many laps, nor did neither know when to stop. Within the first five minutes of the practice, they were already playing a war of attrition to see who lets out first. Ironically, the testee that started later decides to stop earlier, claiming it has been ten laps, and does his heels backs, knee ups, and skips.</p>
								<p>Body language changed; the testee was bouncing back and forth, letting out kicks every once in a while to keep his warm body agile. The instructor found it a safety hazard herself, really only intent on helping the testee, but not intent on getting hurt at any point.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing how ten laps can bring energy back to a person. First to ten wins&rdquo;, the testee stood across the instructor with a sloppy fighting stance.</p>
								<p>No part of this fight was fair. The instructor was at least a foot shorter, sixty pounds lighter, and was frankly quite out of shape. Against all odds though, they engaged in a pretty fair exchange. The testee found himself backed into the corner, faked a punch, and clenched to abuse his body weight to get his instructor towards the walls. In a quick change of momentum, the instructor tripped over. The testee offered his hand to bring his instructor back up.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t stand a chance if I weren&rsquo;t regulating my power.&rdquo; The testee said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you think you chose the wrong instructor then?&rdquo; The instructor replied. &ldquo;Watch your head.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Before the testee was done processing what she said, the instructor let out another kick of vertical height of her legspan, contacting testee by the chin.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Oh I can play this game better than you do.&rdquo; The testee replied with a flurry of kicks aimed at the head, too slow to hit anything, and significantly wearing himself down.</p>
								<p>The two were catching their breath in the center of the asylum, waiting for each other to make the next move. The instructor found her chance, and yelled out, &ldquo;Chun-ji, Junbi.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You play dirty.&rdquo; The testee replied, making a ready stance facing the door.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tag along with you.&rdquo; The instructor said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>The testee made the mistake of making every single move as powerful and pretty as he could. He knew that there are nine forms that are coming next, but he had not internalized that he would be completely out of energy by the end.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Did you just screw up Chun Ji?&rdquo; He said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Shut up, I&rsquo;ve been out of practice for a while.&rdquo; The instructor replied. &ldquo;Tageuk Il Jang.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>The two breezed through their easiest form, both internalized that they would have more to do. While they did the form, they started chatting.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we do these. I would&rsquo;ve screwed up so much during Master Chuang&rsquo;s practice.&rdquo; The instructor said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;When I screw up substantially I kind of just go down for pushups. Sometimes I see Machine look at me weird when the pushups were unsolicited.&rdquo; The testee replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move forward one step.&rdquo; He added, as they entered their next Junbi stance.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Tageuk Ee Jang.&rdquo; The instructor followed.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve never actually competed with this form.&rdquo; The testee said, while doing a high punch.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Learned it over the summer?&rdquo; Instructor asked.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You bet. Spending my summer jumping past the worst poomsae division of ECTC. Yellow belt judges are a crapshoot.&rdquo; The testee replied.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Tageuk Sam Jang.&rdquo; Instructor transitioned naturally.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;And this is where I won my first medal. Was a great tournament. Also got a sparring medal there.&rdquo; The testee brought up.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you think green belt division is easier?&rdquo; Instructor replied.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Electronic scoring in a division of 15 instead of 60 people definitely helps. I met a lot of friends and rivals from the ECTC sitting waiting for my turn.&rdquo; The testee described.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Wow look at you, so social. Looks like your flirting&rsquo;s not limited to girls.&rdquo; The instructor said, while performing a double punch.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Tageuk Sa Jang.&rdquo; Instructor continued to order.</p>
								<p>The testee wiggled a little on his first side kick. There was a period of adjustment going from the basic movements into these intermediate forms.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I bet you don&rsquo;t remember what the next move is.&rdquo; The testee said after his guard block following two side kicks.</p>
								<p>The instructor did not reply. The testee caught the instructor staring to get a hint of the 270 turn into backstance. &ldquo;I called it.&rdquo; He said.</p>
								<p>And after what felt like the most confusing form for the instructor, she couldn&rsquo;t wait but called, &ldquo;Tageuk Oh Jang.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;And Peter has a gold now, and Murdock silvered in nationals last year. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve competed with this form.&rdquo; The testee started getting salty.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t compete with this form either?&rdquo; The instructor asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough time between the last one and this one for another summer.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;There was a period of time that I refused to go to tournaments after starting B team. Started lifting. I wanted to be an absolutely ready heavyweight by the time I step into the ring.&rdquo; The testee gave his excuses. &ldquo;Besides, they had two full teams, both medaled, silver and bronze. Had I gone, I would&rsquo;ve completely messed up that order. Also riding to Princeton really sucks.&rdquo; He continued.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Yeah sure.&rdquo; The instructor gave a long syllable to emphasize that she did not believe a thing that the testee said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Well they were very valid reasons&hellip;&rdquo; Before the testee can finish his argument up, he lost balance on his second side kick. &ldquo;God damn it, we should be focusing.&rdquo; He braced himself back up, and joined his instructor for the stomp, the crowd favourite move.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Tageuk Yuk Jang.&rdquo;, the instructor ignored the fact that they are both extremely short on breath.</p>
								<p>While gasping for breath, the testee continued describing his tournament experience. &ldquo;And when I returned for UVM last year, I got a 4.3 on this form. Really not my thing.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;And you say you were getting prepared by skipping two tournaments?&rdquo; The instructor tried to prove her point.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I did gain ten pounds to make heavy weight; the thought is there. They merc&rsquo;d my ass though; lost two matches in a row, second match in a point gap. I took a bronze medal home though. I tried to give it to Akwasi because I didn&rsquo;t deserve it, and that was his last tournament.&rdquo; The testee described a bad tournament experience.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Tageuk Chil Jang&rdquo; The instructor moved on.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;A medal&rsquo;s a medal. It&rsquo;d probably insulting for Akwasi if he just took it from you.&rdquo; The instructor said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I get it. I guess the thought counts?&rdquo; The testee said. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s another form that I never competed with.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You just work your way up your belt ranks that you&rsquo;ve not competed in many of your forms.&rdquo; The instructor replied.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t substantially slower than you. You just decided to stay a double stripe for two years.&rdquo; The testee said. &ldquo;Murdock took my gold medal from me with this form though. I guess it&rsquo;s just revenge for me knocking him out of top four the previous tournament.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Sad part is you actually don&rsquo;t do this form better than him.&rdquo; The instructor reinforced the testee&rsquo;s loss, making sure that he knew it was his own fault that he lost, and not because their current form was easier.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Tageuk &ndash; Pal &ndash; Jang&rdquo; The instructor orders one syllable at a time, giving herself time to catch her breath.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the form that you spent two years doing.&rdquo; The testee said. &ldquo;Anybody could get a gold medal doing that.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; The instructor interjected, sharing her first experience after the testee played his whole flashback VHS. &ldquo;There was a time when Nina promoted from the blue belt division and knocked me out of top four once she became a red belt while I was doing this form.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Holy crap, Nina.&rdquo; The testee whispered.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;There will always be strong opponents, even if you cheat your way into a bunch of victories.&rdquo; The instructor said, before cutting herself off with the softest sounding kihap during her second double front kick.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Yeah right, national collegiate red belt champion. I&rsquo;m sure your victories are superficial.&rdquo; The testee whined.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Oh please.&rdquo; The instructor tried to divert attention away from her success.</p>
								<p>The two enter their final junbi stance. &ldquo;I am so ready to be done with this.&rdquo; The testee said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Koryo&rdquo; The instructor said, after catching her breath for the five count.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;You have your own thing to brag about. You are the fastest to go white belt to black belt.&rdquo; The instructor said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing I have going for me, and I&rsquo;m keeping it.&rdquo; The testee said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely more satisfying than getting a gold medal; it&rsquo;s a better measure of skill than these random ass tournaments.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Says the one without a gold medal. Master Chuang didn&rsquo;t even want you to take this test&rdquo; The instructor kept the testee on his metaphorical feet during the front kick section. &ldquo;Now watch your sitting stance width.&rdquo; As they take a 270 degree turn.</p>
								<p>The testee, catching the remark slow, stumbles a little bit to widen his sitting stance, falling behind the instructor on the form. &ldquo;God damn it you caught me again.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Are you really that decorated of an athlete for having a bunch of lower division medals though? I&rsquo;ll put weight on just to fight on the more badass division, what have you been doing to challenge yourself?&rdquo; He defended his own pride.</p>
								<p>The testee breaks down without returning to his junbi stance after his last kihap. He crawled on all fours to grab his water. The two took a little break to recover their strength for the next drill.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of going back to Tuesdays.&rdquo; The instructor said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Did not see that coming. I thought getting your contact lenses kicked out was the last straw for you.&rdquo; The testee tried to have his instructor recall her bad memories to have her rinse out her successful tournament memories.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Life is so meaningless. I want to be able to try my hardest, not do half measures like this.&rdquo; The instructor said. &ldquo;I think I should either quit Taekwondo or go back to Tuesdays.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;So choose between heaven and torture chamber. And you chose the torture chamber, I guess you do challenge yourself.&rdquo; The testee flipped over for his thirty pushups. &ldquo;Unlike the five pushups you&rsquo;re doing right now.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s four more than I usually do.&rdquo; The Instructor excused herself of upper body strength.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;By the way, I think those practices have become easier lately.&rdquo; The testee added, to return to the serious topic.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, or do you just suck less now?&rdquo; The instructor tried to remind the testee of his improvement.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve gotten better, but I think Master Chuang has really toned them down, at least compared to the start of the semester where we did these crazy plyobox drills.&rdquo; The testee recalled his bad memories. He loved doing it, making Tuesdays sound the worst experience ever to exemplify his hard work and effort.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Tuesday today? Why are you not there?&rdquo; The instructor asked as the testee finishes his pushups.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I was relieved by Master Chuang so that I could prep up for the black belt test. Looks like he isn&rsquo;t so wildly against me taking the test as I thought. Really got me nervous back when he encouraged me to take the test in December.&rdquo; The testee characteristically provided unsolicited information.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;And will you go back after you&rsquo;re done taking the test?&rdquo; The instructor asked.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I was driven to go to these practices out of desperation for the gold medal. I don&rsquo;t think I have it in me anymore. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to move on.&rdquo; The testee replied.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see your spin techniques.&rdquo; The instructor grabbed paddles and held for a body kick, bracing a tornado kick. &ldquo;I feel like my whole arm&rsquo;s getting kicked off by that.&rdquo; She added.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;That was the objective.&rdquo; The testee tried for another one, tipping the instructor&rsquo;s entire body diagonal.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Too much having fun. Give me Nara-17.&rdquo; The instructor ordered.</p>
								<p>The testee did five repetitions, one worse than the next, until he fell over from the dizziness.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;We have the other leg to go.&rdquo; The instructor added.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll never do this properly.&rdquo; The testee remarked on the inconsistency of his combo.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Nope, you&rsquo;re not getting a gold medal on this one either.&rdquo; The instructor made sure not to feed the testee&rsquo;s griefing.</p>
								<p>The instructor handed the paddles over. The testee didn&rsquo;t have to ask what was going on. He counted every ten kicks until the instructor was done setting an example of what she expected, before taking the paddles, completely out of breath.</p>
								<p>The testee couldn&rsquo;t really hear the instructor counting. He had to rely on his kihaps every ten kicks. He was able to go at a constant speed until 70, sharply regressing into half the speed he started out with, until 90, where he drew his last strength to finish the set quickly. He collapsed on the floor, ready to grab water once again.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Koryo.&rdquo; The instructor said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;God damn.&rdquo; The testee replied.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;We both know this is going to happen in the test.&rdquo; The instructor replied.</p>
								<p>The testee made sure to give her the best Koryo, fixing the narrow sitting stances, the bad eye focus in the sidekick sequence, short front stances, slap chamber, just about everything technical, except for blinking on hand techniques and the extremely audible breathing.</p>
								<p>Without saying a word, the instructor held a paddle up high, standing slightly further than race distance. The testee jumped and landed his board break.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Good job.&rdquo; The instructor said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go run for two miles.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;My back injury&rsquo;s really flaring up.&rdquo; The testee said, trying to weasel out of his practice.</p>
								<p>As the two walked towards the exit of the ZCenter, the testee saw the instructor leave the building. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish the two miles. We aren&rsquo;t doing cut kick jumps this time though.&rdquo; The testee said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be taking it easy on the back injury?&rdquo; The instructor said.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Master Chuang won&rsquo;t be taking it easy.&rdquo; The testee taps into the indoor track, followed by the instructor. &ldquo;I need to show him the best performance to prove that I&rsquo;m a no gold champion unlike you.&rdquo;</p>
