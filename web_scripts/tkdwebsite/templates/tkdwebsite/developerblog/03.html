							<p><strong>Creation of the new TKD Website</strong></p>
							<p>&ldquo;I thought you were exiled from the team. Why would you help redesign their website after such bad treatment?&rdquo; &ndash; Tania Kong, August 2019.</p>
							<p>It was difficult explaining this to a casual friend; the circumstances of my departure from the team aren&rsquo;t exactly what she thought, and I had my own motives to write the website. Here is the long story describing my departure and the creation of this new website.</p>
							<p><strong>Superficial facts before my exile</strong></p>
							<p>First, it is important to clarify that I was never explicitly exiled. The word sound like I was asked to leave by the instructors, when in fact I was the one who begged to be left alone during the end. I&rsquo;ve chosen this word because it truly felt like it. I wasn&rsquo;t booted out by any single person, but the collective culture of the team.</p>
							<p>The specific events that had really pushed me away from the team were three-fold. The most obvious reason being that my relationships in the team were slowly becoming intractable. I&rsquo;ve had a total of six sexual/romantic encounters in the team, and at least two of the most impactful ones ended with a particularly hostile feeling to it. This led to difficulties in me participating in team events.</p>
							<p>Second, I suffered a concussion in Brown 2018 by a highly accomplished fighter from Cortland University. It was a great experience to fight somebody of his caliber, but if I were to graduate from MIT on schedule, I could not risk another major injury. On the note of graduating, this whole hobby&rsquo;s taking time. Not too much time, but inflexible blocks of my time that harm my productivity. Coach Chuang was right that the time was not a reason, but an excuse for my ejection, but I will take whatever socially acceptable reason there is to leave.</p>
							<p>Third, near the end of my involvement, there were rising conflicts between me and the head coach over trivial matters of the team. On a good day, I would have brushed all of this off, but building on the aforementioned difficulties, it just broke the last straw for me. He wasn&rsquo;t happy that I appointed helpers, wasn&rsquo;t happy that I responded to the sports medicine guy, how I handled the joint practice events (which basically got cancelled by the department of athletics), and, on a more private note, didn&rsquo;t like that I went skiing with Elizabeth Zou, that led to her injury. All of this led me to feel that I have to walk on egg shells for the rest of my presidency, and I didn&rsquo;t feel that I wanted to add additional stress to my dire situation. A previous president documented the same feeling as me on the walking on eggshells note. She persevered; I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
							<p><strong>The team&rsquo;s culture</strong></p>
							<p>But all the above were superficial events; symptoms of a greater problem. The underlying issue on all three accounts, is that nobody in the team, with the exception of Elizabeth Zou, understood or supported my difficulties. It is understandable that my problems aren&rsquo;t theirs, but the indifferent culture had felt hostile at times, and that led to the feeling of being exiled. Here is a rant about the cultural aspects that I&rsquo;ve always found to be a problem.</p>
							<p><strong>Lack of Diversity and Inclusion</strong></p>
							<p>This may come off as being a very odd rant. The team has virtually people from all ethnicities, a variety of sexual orientations; the diversity component of the team is clearly established. If there is anybody jokingly racist or sexist at times, I would be the one guilty.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;Diversity is like being invited to the party; inclusion is like being asked to dance at the party. Diversity and inclusion aren&rsquo;t always limited to the main tropes. It can also pertain to backgrounds, upbringing, body types, and educational background&rdquo;, Rachel Dreslinger, June 2019.</p>
							<p>In a diversity and inclusion workshop, the speaker&rsquo;s point of view inadvertently brought up my feelings towards MIT Sport Taekwondo.</p>
							<p>The team is never explicitly non-welcoming to any demographic; clearly there has not been an issue with diversity. However, the inclusion component is extremely questionable. I couldn&rsquo;t count the number of times that my graduate student status or age has been used as a weapon to question everything that I do. &ldquo;Why are you hanging out with a bunch of undergrads like us?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why are you dating an undergraduate?&rdquo;, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting too old for taekwondo, go fix your back injury.&rdquo;. The entire design of the team was catered towards undergraduates; while there was no explicit exclusion of graduate students or older members, we were treated distinctively differently by the very members who brag about their sense of diversity and inclusion.</p>
							<p>Another problem with the inclusion of the team pertains to the personality types of the team. Members such as Anastasiia Uvarova, who clearly attempted to set up their presence in the team but met difficulties (let&rsquo;s just say she&rsquo;s a quieter person) was virtually ignored by the majority of the team. The team prides itself on the parties it hosts, none of which relate to me (and at least one ex-president that I can think of) and many other different personality types. I&rsquo;m not morally offended by the notion of a party with alcohol involved, but the activity itself was boring, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only person who thinks so, but the culture is planted in that flavor.</p>
							<p>Our new social chair has made attempts to diversity the activities; conversations took place that discuss how to avoid the alcoholic theme. Dumpling making at Nick&rsquo;s apartment, they said; Dim Sum, others suggested. In the end, the same popular crowd joins these events, possibly making it a reframed party at an alternative location (I wasn&rsquo;t there, I can&rsquo;t be sure, but I&rsquo;m almost certain that the content of the gatherings were the same). You can&rsquo;t beat the main culture; that&rsquo;s the status of inclusion in this team.</p>
							<p>And near the end, in the middle of my depression, I was unable to participate in any events. I really felt the need to avoid a handful of people (it&rsquo;s not their fault, but I emotionally can&rsquo;t stand being near them). Nobody noticed, nobody asked me to the dance. I couldn&rsquo;t feel that I was part of the team anymore, with the exception of Elizabeth Zou&rsquo;s support, and more often than not she ends up having to choose between spending time with me and spending time with the team. So much for inclusion.</p>
							<p><strong>Person A: Punishing Blunt and Honest Behavior</strong></p>
							<p>I&rsquo;ve been a very distinct personality of the team, and I truly own it. Needless to say, this would generate extremely polarized opinions of my behavior. They love it to death, or want to burn me alive. My problem isn&rsquo;t that people have opinions, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel that my authentic behavior is constantly being punished, and a bunch of fake bitches are getting out for free, either because the team is not calibrated enough to tell, or they&rsquo;re a bunch of pussies that give too much plausible deniability.</p>
							<p>Person A, the individual I hate the most on the team, seems to gather more and more positive attention over time, and it really beats me as to why. He&rsquo;s known to be extremely irresponsible at his work (including his officer work) among the older members; multiple ex-presidents has explicitly asked me to not put him in charge of anything because he is so untrustworthy. On a positive note, I think his responsibility has improved in the last year, but what I really want to comment on is his social behavior.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;I was at the party at Pilam; Person A approached me and told me that the women on the team thinks that you&rsquo;re a bad person, and I should spend less time with you.&rdquo; &ndash; My ex-girlfriend told me, after coming home from a party that I was not at.</p>
							<p>And one year later, Person A had the exact same conversation with Elizabeth Zou.</p>
							<p>Yes, this is the personality that everybody is working with. This member, who acts friendly and gives me a high five every time he spots me, is at the same time talking shit about me behind my back to my closest friends, thinking that they won&rsquo;t tell me about it. (Note: I stopped high fiving him; I figured the best I can do is be honest that I don&rsquo;t want to be friends).</p>
							<p>This same person uses his club&rsquo;s big/little system as a tool to get himself close to his crushes (He was social chair a couple times in the past, and he&rsquo;s made sure to use his powers for his own purposes). I fundamentally don&rsquo;t have a problem with people using their own way to approach a romantic prospect. The problem I have, however, is that people give him the benefit of the doubt that it was &ldquo;just a co-incidence that he made friends with these people&rdquo;, or he was &ldquo;just being friendly&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had my encounters in the team, and I owned them. Oddly enough the majority of the time I was condemned for using my social status to find girls (true but not shameful), mentally abusing girls of younger age (not true), etc. I&rsquo;ve really had enough of the culture where plausible deniability is a trump card.</p>
							<p>Just a last story to put this n perspective. An ex-president, the same one who asked me to never trust Person A to a task, asked me to host an event for the freshmen, so that I could get better acquainted to them as the president. In the group chat, I asked if anybody wants to come over to play a video game which I call &ldquo;the bomb defusual game&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s real name is Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes). Low and behold, Person A hijacks the chat, telling them that my game is stupid, and counter offers everybody to go to his place to play Mario Kart instead. The freshmen actually wanted to go to his event instead.</p>
							<p>Back to ex-president in the private chat, I said, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really keen on this event and I have no intentions on fighting for it, but don&rsquo;t you see now that he is intentionally hostile towards me?&rdquo;.</p>
							<p>The ex-president replied, &ldquo;Uhh I think that was a joke.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>The benefit of the doubt is way too powerful in this team. I want no part of it.</p>
							<p><strong>Person B: Social Justice and Political Correctness</strong></p>
							<p>What better way to describe diversity and inclusion than to discuss the social justice and political correctness of the team. Person B has always been a thorn on my influence of the team.</p>
							<p>On an afternoon, where I was cleaning the club gear in my apartment&rsquo;s bathroom: yes, let me repeat, I dragged bags of smelly gear to my home, dropped them in a bathroom, and cleaned them. That&rsquo;s the effort I spend doing my work for the team, because I take it seriously. Somehow, my pictures of this mess of an operation transpired to a conversation about Cornell in the group chat.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;Fuck Cornell&rdquo;, I said, expressing my rage towards our rivals.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;, Person B replied.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;Nope, Fuck Cornell&rdquo;, I followed up, reinforcing my position.</p>
							<p>And Person B left the chat.</p>
							<p>The team&rsquo;s group chat falls in an instant outrage. Person A started chastising me for it. Soon, two additional people whom have very particular causes to not like me (as opposed to particular causes to support the politically correct climate) decided to also leave the chat.</p>
							<p>And my biggest mistake is to let them back into the chat and apologize. In retrospect, I regret letting them using leaving the chat as a tool against me. The facts were loud and clear in the chatroom: 1. I was the most invested member of the team, who took his job seriously to clean up the club gear; 2. I had the history of engaging Cornell fighters and losing splits to them, while Person B is a newer member who might have not been assimilated to the culture or had that exact experience; 3. The chatroom is a fucking chatroom, and any language should be permitted.</p>
							<p>If somebody had a problem with the incident, they did so long before I used that kind of language in the chat, because their problem pertains to me, and not the phrase &ldquo;Fuck Cornell&rdquo;. And yet, those who do not support political correctness should be immediately condemned because I guess it&rsquo;s 2018. Iris Hwang and Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw came to my defense. I immediately shut them down too. I didn&rsquo;t feel like reading the political debate that was about to come.</p>
							<p>And to this day, Person B continues to use her political correctness against others. Yaseem Rana was once asked to respect women when he told Amazon Alexa to shut up, because disrespecting women was clearly in his mind when he said it. I avoid interacting with her, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she continues to pull this shit.</p>
							<p>The way I see it, Person B is a carbon copy of Person A, who uses social justice and political correctness as part of their plausible deniability. She flirts with the girls in her own deniability (she&rsquo;s a lesbian with a girlfriend, and that&rsquo;s the source of the benefit of the doubt), doesn&rsquo;t do her work properly (I ended up revamping the website after her failed efforts as a webmaster, and I can easily see her turn into the same disgusting trope that our team tends to accept, but when anybody calls her out for it, watch her turn things political.</p>
							<p><strong>Person C: The all-around flip flopper</strong></p>
							<p>Throughout my depression, seeing my ex-girlfriend attempting to spite me, dealing with persons A and B, comes person C. Person C has no explicitly negative personality traits like persons A or B, but the way they behave just takes a dump on my sanity.</p>
							<p>Person C is friendly, listens to my problems, and has a great record of being a responsible officer. However, they are also extremely friendly to Person A, Person B, my ex-girlfriend, another person that rejected me, the head coach, my other adversaries on the team, etc. It&rsquo;s almost like they want the best of every single member on the team, and such is a great strategy for making close friends.</p>
							<p>Except for me. I feel that I no longer want to be a close friend to Person C, because they lack an opinion. While they would agree with every rant of mine on the trash behavior of the team, he would proceed to befriending all of them in the next instant. I don&rsquo;t have the right to demand that they take a side, but I reserve to have the feelings that I no longer want to be friends.</p>
							<p>One day, I had a realization. At least half the members on the team is a Person C, including Persons A and B.</p>
							<p>I can&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
							<p>Persons A and B were already extremely loud and part of every single conversation. Fill the rest of the conversation group with People C, I quickly find that I am unable to be part of any conversation. I felt exiled.</p>
							<p><strong>Four People that Stood Up for Me</strong></p>
							<p>I could think of a grand total of four people, who took an authentic stance for me.</p>
							<p>Iris Hwang stood up for me in a conversation with my ex-girlfriend, asking her to stop spiting me. I don&rsquo;t know how that conversation went, but she obviously didn&rsquo;t give my ex-girlfriend the benefit of the doubt and sided with me. Iris and I disagree on many ends, and as a result we aren&rsquo;t close friends, but she took a stance, and I highly respect her for her authenticity. The future of the team is in good hands in that regard.</p>
							<p>Anastasiia Uvarova has almost always sided with me in conflicts. She isn&rsquo;t very vocal, so her support isn&rsquo;t explicitly voiced, but part of my exile was due to her going home to Russia for a semester, and the one less preson to trust pushed me over the edge.</p>
							<p>Yaseem Rana was an honest and hard working man. He had the calibration to find the fake people, and it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise to see that he is on my side. He left the team, like I did, presumably for different reasons. Seeing that he had the calibration, it&rsquo;s not too far of a stretch to think that he doesn&rsquo;t find MIT Sport Taekwondo as a good cultural fit.</p>
							<p>Elizabeth Zou happened to hear my perspective before others when she joined the team and exhibited a radically different set of behaviors. Towards the end of our friendship, I saw that she didn&rsquo;t have a well formed thought and started turning her friendships on and off; as a friend I did not want to side with her constantly changing opinion, and terminated the friendship; but while she was still my friend, my sanity was single handedly held together by Elizabeth. I just wish that she did not use her allegiance with me as a weapon against me by threatening to side with others (would&rsquo;ve been better if she really believed my stance, but whatever).</p>
							<p><strong>Unappreciated Work</strong></p>
							<p>As I&rsquo;ve briefly touched upon, my work was largely unappreciated. What I presented to coach Chuang was autonomy, that I believe none of the ex-presidents had. I go to my supervisor with work already done, ready for critique, as opposed to ask about every step along the way. I suppose this is a stark personality mismatch, and I do not hold it against Coach Chuang that he didn&rsquo;t vibe well with my style. These instances would manifest as the superficial events that took place near the end of my presidency.</p>
							<p>However, I want to talk a little bit about the rest of the team&rsquo;s perception towards my work.</p>
							<p>For one, the officers weren&rsquo;t exactly easy to work with. Gina says I should delegate more; I think people should listen more, and there&rsquo;s always a balance. Whereas most people think I&rsquo;m bossing them around, because they had to do a ton, I was leading by example, where the amount of work that I&rsquo;ve done is disproportionately more than the others. Their selective focus isn&rsquo;t on appreciation though, and they may have missed the good work that I&rsquo;ve done, as opposed to the work that I&rsquo;ve assigned them to.</p>
							<p>One major change that I made was that the equipment manager is no longer in charge of gathering equipment every practice, and that responsibility is to be split between all members (led by officers). More work for the officers; Lawrence was so bossy. If they had spent their time working out after practice more, they would find out that most of the time I had to be single handedly in charge of putting mats away that others didn&rsquo;t and putting equipment away that other people asked for. Their selective focus wasn&rsquo;t on what I did and didn&rsquo;t care to appreciate.</p>
							<p>Speaking of equipment, I was the only one that cared to clean all the gear and organize it. With a week of use they became disorganized again. Nobody noticed.</p>
							<p>Also collected $3k through crowdfunding. Nobody really talks about it. It&rsquo;s very easy to focus on the &ldquo;faults&rdquo; of Lawrence as opposed to his accomplishments.</p>
							<p>Not to mention the largest incoming class; every officer will attempt claim credit, and I believe everybody was part of the success. Some may argue that the random variability played more of a role than Lawrence, but my recruiting strategy is radically different from past presidents, and that should also be accounted for. My strategy was to lead with energy, humor, single out quieter members so that they feel engaged, focus less on giving, and more on asking (past officers would hand out a ton of freebies to &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; newbies). I guess the size of the next class will tell, assuming that Iris does not replicate my strategies.</p>
							<p>The officers were difficult to work with. Some just would not take any input from me, spend 12 hours on a 1 hour job, asking me for advice, and subsequently ignoring it after they didn&rsquo;t like it and went to ask Iris instead. Other officers didn&rsquo;t do their job, such as the&hellip;</p>
							<p><strong>Website</strong></p>
							<p>&ldquo;They do not deserve your work&rdquo; &ndash; Elizabeth Koze, June 2019.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;No, but they will benefit from it&rdquo; &ndash; I replied.</p>
							<p>Took a long rant to get to the website part, but I wanted to document all the emotions that led up to this. In a conversation I had with Iris, all she could think of was that I wanted to troll, and ruin her team&rsquo;s website. The team&rsquo;s culture.</p>
							<p>There were many personal benefits; this is a great website design experience that could reinforce my engineering skills, I could brag about it, the team will benefit from it, etc.</p>
							<p>When Iris said no, I told her she could keep the shitty website that she has.</p>
							<p>And then I went rogue to redesign it anyways.</p>
							<p>I did it for the spite.</p>
							<p>This is a reminder that the team does not deserve my work, and the quality of this website is a testament to that statement. The team lost much through my exile. This website will be a constant reminder of their mistake, and my name will forever be in the footer (until somebody else decides to redesign it).</p>
							<p>I am the bigger person, who instead of sending a salty e-mail when I left, encouraged everybody to not leave. On the same vein, I am the bigger person, instead of sabotaging the website, redesigned it to look good; such a demonstration is the best I can do over the destruction that I am capable of.</p>
